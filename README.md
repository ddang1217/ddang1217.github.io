# [Brazil Target Data Project (2016-2018)](https://github.com/ddang1217/brazil_target_project)

This is a project I did for my school where I had to analyze Target's performance in Brazil from the year of 2016 to 2018

* Dataset was taken from this kaggle dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ujjwalinsights/target-case-study-using-sql)
* Used Jupyter Notebook and Postgres for data analysis
* Used PowerBI for visualization found [here](https://github.com/ddang1217/brazil_target_project/blob/main/Target%20Stores%20in%20Brazil.pbix)

  

## Examples of Reports I generated

Amazonas has the highest average delivery time of all the states
